GhostLoader - AppDomainManager - Injection - 攻壳机动队



GhostLoader Steps :)


```
1. Create C:\Tools
2. Copy Some .NET, any .NET binary to C:\Tools
3. In this example, we use FileHistory.exe, but any .NET app will do.
4. Ensure FileHistory.exe.config is in the same path
5. Execute C:\Tools\FileHistory.exe

Does your tool/product detect/observe the Image Load Event?

The purpose of this example is to demonstrate a way to circumvent, tools that catch/prevent ImageLoad events.

```
